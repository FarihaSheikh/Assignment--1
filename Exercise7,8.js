// Number Eight: Write addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations that each result in the number 8. 
// Be sure to enclose your operations in print statements to see the results.
// You should create four lines that look like this:
// console.log(5 + 3)
// Your output should simply be four lines with the number 8 appearing once on each line.
