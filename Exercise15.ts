// so you need to send out a new set of invitations.You’ll have to think of someone else to invite.

// • Start with your program from Exercise 14. Add a print statement at the end of your program stating the name of the guest
//  who can’t make it.

// • Modify your list, replacing the name of the guest who can’t make it with the name of the new person you are inviting.

// • Print a second set of invitation messages, one for each person who is still in your list.
